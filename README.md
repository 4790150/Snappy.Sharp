# Snappy.Sharp

An implementation of Google's Snappy compression algorithm in C#.

This is *very much* a work in progress, especially the streaming stuff. 

The current status is that I think the compression and expansion algorithms work right. I have only tested this on Win7/64-bit/.NET Framework 4 though, and changing any one of those could make this blow up. The streaming stuff has only just been started and shouldn't even be used.
